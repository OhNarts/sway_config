# Intro
This is my personal sway config, using waybar for the top bar. If you'd like to use, follow the following instructions

## Installation
### Fedora
```
    sudo dnf install sway
    sudo dnf install waybar
    sudo reboot
```

## Setup
1. Download a wallpaper to use as your background
2. Clone this repository into the `~/.config` directory
3. Rename the folder to `sway`
4. Replace line 27 in config to be the path to the previous wallpaper
5. Press `Ctrl+Shift+c` to reload the config
